!!! notes
    Due to many updates in the data format provided by the different companies, you might have issues loading your data. In this case, consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/issues) detailing the version of the machine you used and the error log, as well as an example of file names that you are trying to read.

!!! notes "Related to `spatialdata-io`"
    A library called [`spatialdata-io`](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/projects/io/en/latest/) already contains a lot of readers. Here, we updated some readers already existing in `spatialdata-io`, and added a few others. In the future, we will completely rely on `spatialdata-io`.
